Large Scale Social and Complex Networks: Design and Algorithms
Description: (Formerly numbered Electrical Engineering 232E.) Lecture, four hours; recitation, one hour; outside study, seven hours. Modeling and design of large-scale complex networks, including social networks, peer-to-peer file-sharing networks, World Wide Web, and gene networks. Modeling of characteristic topological features of complex networks, such as power laws and percolation threshold. Mining topology to design algorithms for various applications, such as e-mail spam detection, friendship recommendations, viral popularity, and epidemics. Introduction to network algorithms, computational complexity, and nondeterministic, polynomial-time completeness. Letter grading.
